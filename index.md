## About Me

I'm a Biostatistics Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank"> Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine</a>, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://www.preventivemedicine.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=16163" target="_blank"> Denise M Scholtens</a>. My research involves developing statistical models and deep learning methods that address complex maternal data, expecially Missingness in Time Series data.

My academic journey began at <a href="https://www.whu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank"> Wuhan University</a>, China where I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Life Science and Biotechnology. Thereafter, I moved to the New York to complete my Master's degree in Biostatistics from <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics" target = "_blank"> Columbia University</a>, under the guidance of Prof. <a href= "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/qixuan-chen-phd" target = "_blank"> Qixuan Chen</a> and Prof. <a href= "https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/little-roderick.html" target = "_blank"> Roderick Joseph Little</a> from the <a href= "https://sph.umich.edu/" target = "_blank"> University of Michigan</a>. Post my Masterâ€™s, I worked as a Data Analyst at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, which honed my analytical skills further.
